#IM ALJOHN

Hello! i am aljohn nanteza, im 16 years old,
i have built-in entrepreneurship in my blood ðŸ˜¸, and i also code a little bit, but i do not intend to make my codes harmful to anyone, as it focuses more on games. (sometimes yeah i admit im messing around too)
I've made 214K or $4K by doing codes and selling them, and trading as well. i do not know how to communicate in real life, im more on playing and selling stuff, thats my hobby and what i really want.
